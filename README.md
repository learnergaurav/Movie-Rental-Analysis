## 📈 Process Breakdown

### 1. 📥 Dataset Acquisition from GitHub:

* Downloaded movie rental relational datasets in `.csv` format from an open-source GitHub repository.
* Verified schema relationships across all 15+ tables.

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning (ETL Process):

* Performed standard cleaning: handling null values, correcting datatypes, removing duplicates.
* Created relational joins between keys (foreign & primary) to replicate a normalized database.
* Ensured consistency in categorical fields (like language, category, city).

### 3. 🔎 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Used **SQL queries** to derive key insights: customer segmentation, film popularity, store performance, rental trends.
* **Excel** supported quick tabular summaries and pivot analyses for stakeholder-friendly views.

### 4. 📊 Power BI Dashboard Creation:

* Developed a dynamic, interactive dashboard covering:

  * Rental Trends over time
  * Top-performing films & categories
  * Revenue by customer type and location
  * Store comparison and peak rental hours
* Built slicers, drill-throughs, and KPIs for executive-level decision-making.

### 5. 🧠 Insight Generation using MECE:

* Segmented insights into Customer, Film, Inventory, Staff, Store, and Sales dimensions.
* Focused on actionable findings (e.g., repeat customers drive 70%+ revenue, specific categories outperform others).

### 6. 📢 Presentation & Reporting:

* Delivered a concise PowerPoint business presentation highlighting insights and recommendations.
* Designed executive summaries suitable for non-technical stakeholders.
